    """
    Compute a theoretical gravitational constant using a critical density argument.
    
    The idea:
      • In cosmology the critical density is given by
          ρ_c = 3/(8πG).
      • If one assumes that the mass of the universe M_universe is uniformly 
        distributed over a sphere of radius R_H, the (average) density is
          ρ = M_universe / ( (4/3)πR_H³ ).
      • Equating ρ with ρ_c (up to a calibration factor) allows solving for G.
    
    Rearranging, we get:
          G = 3/(8πρ) =  (3 (4/3)πR_H³) / (8π M_universe)
            = (R_H³) / (2 M_universe)
    
    (The constants here can be tuned; this is one “flavor” of the derivation.)

    In many holographic arguments the gravitational interaction is related to the 
    surface area (A) of the cosmic horizon:
          A = 4πR_H².
    
    One may then propose a relation of the form:
          G ∝ 1 / A  =  1/(4πR_H²).

    Compute a theoretical gravitational constant inspired by entropic gravity ideas.
    
    In certain entropic gravity derivations one ends up with a relation which 
    (in natural units) might be expressed simply as an inverse dependence on R_H.
    For example, one could have:
          G ∝ 1 / R_H.
